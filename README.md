Steganography Project Skeleton
This project implements basic steganography techniques for securely embedding and extracting messages within digital images. The program will support encoding and decoding functionalities, allowing users to hide sensitive information within the least significant bits (LSBs) of image pixels. The initial setup includes the following modules:

1. **Image Processing:** Loading, manipulating, and saving images.
2. **Encoding:** Embedding a secret message into an image.
3. **Decoding:** Extracting the hidden message from the image.
4. **User Interface:** Command-line interface for user interaction.

The project will use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing and ensure the hidden message remains invisible to the human eye.

# 2
To begin, we will start by setting up the basic structure of the project. <br>
This includes creating a main script to handle the user inputs and coordinate the encoding and decoding processes. 
We'll also define functions for reading and writing images using the PIL library, ensuring that the images are processed in a way that allows us to manipulate the pixel data.<br> 
The encoding function will take a message and embed it into the image's pixels, while the decoding function will retrieve the hidden message. Each step will be modularized to maintain clarity and ease of maintenance.

# 3
Next, we will implement the encoding function. This function will convert the secret message into a binary format and embed it into the image by modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of selected pixels. 
The process will involve iterating through the image pixels and systematically altering the LSBs to store the message bits. 
Care will be taken to ensure that the visual integrity of the image remains intact. 
Additionally, we will include a check to ensure that the message size does not exceed the maximum capacity of the image, preventing data loss or corruption.


# 4
Following the encoding process, we will develop the decoding function; This function will reverse the encoding process by extracting the binary data from the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image's pixels. 
The extracted binary data will then be converted back into a readable text format, revealing the hidden message. 
The decoding function will be designed to handle various image formats and ensure accurate message retrieval, even in cases where the image has undergone minimal transformations, such as slight resizing or format conversion.


# 5
To ensure the robustness of the program, we will incorporate error handling and validation mechanisms. 
This includes checking for common issues, such as unsupported image formats, insufficient image capacity for the message, and potential data corruption. 
We will also validate user inputs to prevent errors during the encoding and decoding processes.
These safeguards will enhance the reliability of the program, making it resilient to unexpected inputs and providing clear error messages to guide the user in resolving any issues.

# 6
For the user interface, a command-line interface (CLI) will be implemented to allow users to interact with the program easily. 
The CLI will prompt users to select between encoding and decoding modes, specify the image file, and input the message or provide the path to retrieve the hidden message.
 Clear instructions and prompts will guide the user through each step of the process. 
 Additionally, we'll implement options for the user to customize parameters such as output file names and error messages, ensuring flexibility and ease of use. 
 Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface (GUI) to further improve accessibility.

# 7
After implementing the core functionality, we will focus on testing and verification. 
This involves testing the program with various images of different formats and sizes to ensure the encoding and decoding processes work correctly across different scenarios. 
We will also test edge cases, such as attempting to embed a message larger than the image capacity or using images with minimal color variation. 
Proper testing will help verify that the program can handle a range of situations and that the hidden messages remain undetectable under normal viewing conditions.

# 8
Finally, we will consider future enhancements to improve the program's functionality and security. 
Potential upgrades include implementing encryption to further protect the hidden message, adding support for different file formats beyond images (such as audio or video), and creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
 Additionally, more advanced steganography techniques could be explored, such as adaptive steganography, which varies the embedding method based on image content to further minimize detection. These enhancements would broaden the program's applicability and improve its security and usability.

 # 9
In conclusion, this steganography project provides a foundation for securely embedding and retrieving messages within images. 
By focusing on a modular design, thorough testing, and future improvements, the program will offer both flexibility and reliability. 
As the project evolves, the integration of advanced techniques and user interface enhancements will further increase its security and ease of use, making it a versatile tool for those interested in steganography and secure communication.
