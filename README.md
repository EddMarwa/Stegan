Steganography Project Skeleton

This project implements basic steganography techniques for securely embedding and extracting messages within digital images. The program will support encoding and decoding functionalities, allowing users to hide sensitive information within the least significant bits (LSBs) of image pixels. The initial setup includes the following modules:

1. **Image Processing:** Loading, manipulating, and saving images.
2. **Encoding:** Embedding a secret message into an image.
3. **Decoding:** Extracting the hidden message from the image.
4. **User Interface:** Command-line interface for user interaction.

The project will use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing and ensure the hidden message remains invisible to the human eye.
